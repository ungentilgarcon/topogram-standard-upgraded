# Topogram (topogram-standard-upgraded)

This README summarizes recent development activity (last ~3 weeks) across branches. It focuses on UI selection sync, GeoMap/Cytoscape integration, CSV import/export, charts, timeline improvements, and Meteor 3 migration work.

## Overview of recent changes (last 3 weeks)

Summary of notable commits (titles and context):

- GeoMap selection and clickability fixes (branch: `selectviageomap` / merged to `main`) — multiple commits:
  - `GeoMap: toggle selection via ui.selectedElements instead of requiring cy` — make map selection work even when `cy` isn't passed.
  - `GeoMap: add invisible hit-area CircleMarker for small nodes` — improve clickability for small markers.
  - `GeoMap: make hit-area markers interactive (fillOpacity) for more reliable clicks` — ensure Leaflet reliably dispatches clicks.
  - `GeoMap: ensure geoNodes carry viz id (data.id) matching Cytoscape` — align map node IDs with Cytoscape ids.
  - `GeoMap: pass canonical node/edge json (group + data.id) to selection handlers` — ensure parent receives canonical JSON.
  - `GeoMap: ensure node json has no source/target fields to avoid misclassification as edges` — remove stray edge-like fields on node JSON.

- Selection panel and export (branch: `exporttopotocsv` / merged to `main`):
  - `SelectionPanel: add Export CSV for selected nodes/edges with customizable title` — export selected elements as CSV matching ImportCsvModal layout.
  - `SelectionPanel: wire show/hide toggle and parent-controlled mounting; persist selectionPanelPinned in localStorage` — settings toggle, persistent pin state, parent-controlled mounting so popup close works.
  - Several `export:` commits improving filename sanitization, CRLF usage, and title sanitization.

- Charts and selection integration (branch: `chartsandselection` / merged):
  - `charts: highlight edge donut slice when selected` and related commits — charts now reflect selection and drive Cytoscape selection/unselection.
  - `cytoscape: add selected styles for nodes and edges` — visual improvements.

- Popup and UI behavior
  - Multiple fixes and improvements to `Popup` to make pop-out, close handling, drag/stop behavior, and light theme consistent.

- CSV import and server
  - `CSV import: robust node id mapping, edge label/color persistence, job error logging; fix async collection calls` and server worker registration.

- Timeline and UI wiring
  - Timeline play/pause/step controls, slider persistence, timeline filtering, and timeline UI wiring into TopogramDetail.

## Files and components touched

- `imports/ui/components/geoMap/*` (GeoMap, GeoNodes, GeoEdges) — selection handling, interactive hit areas, JSON canonicalization.
- `imports/ui/components/SelectionPanel/SelectionPanel.jsx` — Export CSV UI; export logic reusing Topogram CSV format.
- `imports/ui/pages/TopogramDetail.jsx` — glue between Cytoscape, GeoMap, SelectionPanel, Charts; ensures `data.id` alignment, selection state, timeline filtering.
- `imports/ui/components/charts/*` — updates to reflect selection and drive cytoscape selection.
- `imports/client/helpers` & server endpoints for CSV import/export.
- `imports/ui/components/common/Popup.jsx` — popout/close improvements.

## Recent edits (2025-10-13)

- Emoji & edge-relationship support:
  - CSV import now accepts an `emoji` (or `em`/`icon`) column for both nodes and edges. The importer normalizes LibreOffice-encoded segments, extracts up to 3 grapheme-cluster emojis, and stores them on documents (`node.data.emoji`, `edge.data.relationshipEmoji`).
  - Network UI: added selectors to choose how node labels and edge relationship labels are displayed (Name | Emoji | Both for nodes; Text | Emoji | Both for edges). Labels update immediately in the network view without remounting Cytoscape.
  - GeoMap: midpoint relationship labels follow the selected edge label mode and can show emoji, text, or both. Chevrons remain a global drawing convention and per-edge arrowheads (CSV `enlightement = 'arrow'`) are respected.
  - Sample CSV: the sample now includes multi-emoji examples and the download is prefixed with a UTF-8 BOM so LibreOffice and Excel detect UTF-8 and show emoji correctly. A short note appears in the import dialog describing this.
  - Branch: changes were developed on branch `edgerelationshipasemoji` and pushed for review.

## Upgrade branches (migration / Meteor 3 prep)

Additional commits on upgrade/migration branches that were part of the Meteor 3 port and preparatory work. The branches include `upgrade/m3-port`, `upgrade/m3-prep`, and `topogram-m3-migration`.

- `upgrade/m3-port` (examples from recent commits)
  - `fix(sanitize): clamp numeric node/edge fields on ingest + add migration to sanitize existing docs` — data sanitization and migration scripts to clean legacy numeric fields when importing under Meteor 3.
  - `feat(router): add /t/:id route, Home list with links, and detail view` — scaffolding for routes, publications and methods (topograms/nodes/edges).
  - `chore: scaffold Meteor 3 app with upgraded stack deps and dev scripts` — initial Meteor 3 scaffolding.

- `upgrade/m3-prep` (migration prep and historic upstream commits)
  - `chore(migration): add plan and dev env scaffolding` — migration plan and developer environment scaffolding.
  - This branch also contains historic Topogram commits preserved during the prep step (many UI and timeline-related improvements dating back to earlier upstream work).

- `topogram-m3-migration`
  - `migrate: Topogram Meteor3 client fixes` — client-side adjustments for Meteor 3: Cytoscape presets, color & weight normalization, layout selector, title-size UI, and adjusted publications/mappings.
  - Timeline and UI wiring for migration: TimeLine placeholders, minimal Redux/store wiring, geo/network view toggles and side-panel wiring.

## Recent commits (branch: arrowed-links)

The most recent work on branch `arrowed-links` focuses on GeoMap midpoint label placement, UI prop propagation, and minor polish for geo/network arrow rendering:

- 82335c0 working enough3
- bbb50c8 working enough2
- 2aa742a working enough
- 7ca2a0f Revert "Cytoscape: precompute per-edge numeric style fields and restrict color mappings to avoid mapData/mapping warnings"
- dc2d38a Cytoscape: precompute per-edge numeric style fields and restrict color mappings to avoid mapData/mapping warnings
- 865cbf3 Geo: pass ui and map refs to GeoEdges/GeoNodes so UI toggles affect map layers
- c0e079d Geo: increase pixel-space label separation (larger normal offset, more jitter)
- 2aebb63 Geo: pixel-space tangent/normal offsets and longitudinal jitter for midpoint labels
- fadde57 Geo: use map.project/unproject for pixel-space midpoint label placement; pass map ref to GeoEdges
- efd9298 Geo: alternate midpoint label placement above/below edge and reduce distance
- d2ab429 Geo: increase midpoint label offsets and jitter to reduce overlap
- 186553e Geo: jitter midpoint labels to reduce overlap; Cytoscape parallel-edge styling and propagate edge fields

Please see `CHANGELOG.md` for a concise entry (appended there as well).

These branches represent the migration effort to prepare the app for Meteor 3 and sanitize legacy data. They include scaffolding, router updates, migration scripts, and compatibility fixes.

## Testing notes / how to verify

1. Start the app locally (Meteor): ensure dependencies are installed and run the Meteor app as in the project instructions.
2. Open a Topogram that contains geo nodes and network nodes.
   - Verify split view (network + map): selecting nodes in the network highlights on the map and vice versa.
   - Click small nodes on the map — selection should reliably register (increased hit-area).
   - Selected items should appear under the Selection panel under the correct category (Nodes vs Edges).
3. Export behavior:
   - Use the Export CSV from the main Topogram view to download a full CSV (title + header + rows).
   - Use SelectionPanel -> Export CSV to export only selected nodes/edges. Provide an optional title and verify filename sanitization and the CSV format.
4. Charts:
   - Select nodes/edges in charts (donut slices) and observe Cytoscape selection and the selection panel updating.

## Branches / PRs of interest

- `selectviageomap` — GeoMap selection fixes (merged to `main`).
- `exporttopotocsv` — SelectionPanel CSV export (merged to `main`).
- `chartsandselection` — Charts and selection integration (merged to `main`).
- `CSV_import` — CSV import server and client updates.
- `upgrade/m3-port`, `upgrade/m3-prep`, `topogram-m3-migration` — migration/upgrade branches for Meteor 3.

## Notes & next steps

- Consider adding an automated test or a small integration test for map->cy selection flow.
- Optionally add a small visual tooltip or toast to confirm export success/failure.
- If any selection still shows misclassification (node showing under edges), capture the node's `data.id` and a screenshot; the code now passes canonical JSON but some legacy data shapes may still cause mismatches.
