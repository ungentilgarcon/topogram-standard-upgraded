# Topogram (topogram-standard-upgraded)

This README summarizes recent development activity (last ~3 weeks) across branches. It focuses on UI selection sync, GeoMap/Cytoscape integration, CSV import/export, charts, and timeline improvements.

## Overview of recent changes (last 3 weeks)

Summary of notable commits (titles and context):

- GeoMap selection and clickability fixes (branch: `selectviageomap` / merged to `main`) — multiple commits:
  - `GeoMap: toggle selection via ui.selectedElements instead of requiring cy` — make map selection work even when `cy` isn't passed.
  - `GeoMap: add invisible hit-area CircleMarker for small nodes` — improve clickability for small markers.
  - `GeoMap: make hit-area markers interactive (fillOpacity) for more reliable clicks` — ensure Leaflet reliably dispatches clicks.
  - `GeoMap: ensure geoNodes carry viz id (data.id) matching Cytoscape` — align map node IDs with Cytoscape ids.
  - `GeoMap: pass canonical node/edge json (group + data.id) to selection handlers` — ensure parent receives canonical JSON.
  - `GeoMap: ensure node json has no source/target fields to avoid misclassification as edges` — remove stray edge-like fields on node JSON.

- Selection panel and export (branch: `exporttopotocsv` / merged to `main`):
  - `SelectionPanel: add Export CSV for selected nodes/edges with customizable title` — export selected elements as CSV matching ImportCsvModal layout.
  - `SelectionPanel: wire show/hide toggle and parent-controlled mounting; persist selectionPanelPinned in localStorage` — settings toggle, persistent pin state, parent-controlled mounting so popup close works.
  - Several `export:` commits improving filename sanitization, CRLF usage, and title sanitization.

- Charts and selection integration (branch: `chartsandselection` / merged):
  - `charts: highlight edge donut slice when selected` and related commits — charts now reflect selection and drive Cytoscape selection/unselection.
  - `cytoscape: add selected styles for nodes and edges` — visual improvements.

- Popup and UI behavior
  - Multiple fixes and improvements to `Popup` to make pop-out, close handling, drag/stop behavior, and light theme consistent.

- CSV import and server
  - `CSV import: robust node id mapping, edge label/color persistence, job error logging; fix async collection calls` and server worker registration.

- Timeline and UI wiring
  - Timeline play/pause/step controls, slider persistence, timeline filtering, and timeline UI wiring into TopogramDetail.

## Files and components touched

- `imports/ui/components/geoMap/*` (GeoMap, GeoNodes, GeoEdges) — selection handling, interactive hit areas, JSON canonicalization.
- `imports/ui/components/SelectionPanel/SelectionPanel.jsx` — Export CSV UI; export logic reusing Topogram CSV format.
- `imports/ui/pages/TopogramDetail.jsx` — glue between Cytoscape, GeoMap, SelectionPanel, Charts; ensures `data.id` alignment, selection state, timeline filtering.
- `imports/ui/components/charts/*` — updates to reflect selection and drive cytoscape selection.
- `imports/client/helpers` & server endpoints for CSV import/export.
- `imports/ui/components/common/Popup.jsx` — popout/close improvements.

## Testing notes / how to verify

1. Start the app locally (Meteor): ensure dependencies are installed and run the Meteor app as in the project instructions.
2. Open a Topogram that contains geo nodes and network nodes.
   - Verify split view (network + map): selecting nodes in the network highlights on the map and vice versa.
   - Click small nodes on the map — selection should reliably register (increased hit-area).
   - Selected items should appear under the Selection panel under the correct category (Nodes vs Edges).
3. Export behavior:
   - Use the Export CSV from the main Topogram view to download a full CSV (title + header + rows).
   - Use SelectionPanel -> Export CSV to export only selected nodes/edges. Provide an optional title and verify filename sanitization and the CSV format.
4. Charts:
   - Select nodes/edges in charts (donut slices) and observe Cytoscape selection and the selection panel updating.

## Branches / PRs of interest

- `selectviageomap` — GeoMap selection fixes (merged to `main`).
- `exporttopotocsv` — SelectionPanel CSV export (merged to `main`).
- `chartsandselection` — Charts and selection integration (merged to `main`).
- `CSV_import` — CSV import server and client updates.

## Notes & next steps

- Consider adding an automated test or a small integration test for map->cy selection flow.
- Optionally add a small visual tooltip or toast to confirm export success/failure.
- If any selection still shows misclassification (node showing under edges), capture the node's `data.id` and a screenshot; the code now passes canonical JSON but some legacy data shapes may still cause mismatches.
