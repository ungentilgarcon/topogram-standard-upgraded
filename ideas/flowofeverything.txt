 1. The Global Supply Chain Graph of Everything
Idea:
A live network showing how every major consumer product’s components move across the world — linking mines, factories, ports, and retailers.
Why it’s astonishing:
You’d see the hidden web of globalization — how a phone connects lithium mines in Chile to factories in Shenzhen to customers in New York.
Each node = production site; edges = transport routes; color = industry sector.
Data sources:
    • UN Comtrade dataset (global trade flows)
    • AIS (ship tracking) data
    • Company supply-chain disclosures (e.g., Apple, Tesla, IKEA reports)
    • OpenStreetMap for geolocation
Wow factor:
Animate it through time to see shocks (pandemic, Suez Canal blockage) ripple through the network.


1. TRADE FLOWS (Edges Between Countries or Companies)
These give you the macroscopic network — who trades with whom, and what they trade.
🔹 Global trade datasets
Source Description Access
UN Comtrade The go-to source for global import/export data (by HS code, value, volume). Can trace flow of goods between any two countries. https://comtradeplus.un.org/
OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) Links trade flows to value-added chains (shows how production is globally fragmented). https://stats.oecd.org/
World Input-Output Database (WIOD) Connects industries and countries through input–output tables. Ideal for modeling dependencies between sectors. http://www.wiod.org/
BACI (by CEPII) Harmonized version of Comtrade with improved consistency. https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=37
ITC Trade Map Visual trade flows and product breakdowns (limited open access). https://www.trademap.org/
🏭 2. COMPANY-LEVEL SUPPLY CHAINS (Micro-Level Network)
These datasets and disclosures link specific firms and their suppliers — crucial for connecting trade data to real-world companies and facilities.
🔹 Corporate disclosures
Source Description Access
Open Supply Hub (formerly Open Apparel Registry) Open database of manufacturing facilities across industries (textiles, agriculture, etc.) with company ownership links. https://opensupplyhub.org/
Refinitiv / FactSet supply-chain data Proprietary, but subsets are public via research collaborations. Shows supplier-customer relationships. Paid / API
Apple, Tesla, IKEA Supplier Lists Many large firms publish supplier names and locations for transparency. Corporate websites
CDP Supply Chain Program Companies self-report environmental impacts and supply chain links. https://www.cdp.net/
U.S. SEC Filings (10-K, 20-F) Contain partial supplier information and logistics dependencies. https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/
🚢 3. LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORT (Edges = Real Shipments)
This layer animates the network — how goods physically move across the world.
🔹 Maritime & Air Transport
Source Description Access
MarineTraffic AIS / AISHub Real-time ship tracking via AIS data — vessel routes, cargo types, ports. https://www.marinetraffic.com/
UNCTAD Port Calls Dataset Aggregated AIS data by port, showing trade intensity. https://unctadstat.unctad.org/
OpenSky Network Open air traffic data — could link to air cargo movements. https://opensky-network.org/
World Port Index (NOAA/NGA) Master list of global ports with location and characteristics. https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/WPI
🗺️ 4. GEOLOCATION AND MAPPING (Coordinates & Context)
To plot facilities, routes, and flows on a map.
Source Description Access
OpenStreetMap (OSM) Base map and geocoding of industrial sites, ports, roads, railways. https://www.openstreetmap.org/
GeoNames Global database of place names and coordinates. https://www.geonames.org/
Natural Earth / GADM Country and region boundaries for visualization. https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
♻️ 5. MATERIAL FLOWS & INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
For mapping how materials transform across the supply chain (e.g., lithium → battery → EV).
Source Description Access
Material Flow Analysis (UNEP IRP) Global datasets on flows of raw materials and resources. https://www.resourcepanel.org/
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Production and reserves of raw materials by country. https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic
FAOSTAT (for food chains) Production, trade, and consumption of agricultural products. https://www.fao.org/faostat/
🧭 6. OPTIONAL: ESG + HUMAN IMPACT DATA
To show not just movement, but impact (carbon, labor, deforestation).
Source Description Access
World Bank Climate Data CO₂ emissions, energy use, etc. https://data.worldbank.org/
Global Forest Watch Deforestation and supply chain linkages (e.g., palm oil, soy). https://www.globalforestwatch.org/
Trase Earth Trade-linked deforestation data by commodity. https://trase.earth/
⚙️ Integration Strategy
You could construct the graph in layers:
 Start with trade flows between countries/sectors (UN Comtrade + TiVA).
 Map known company supply chains (Open Supply Hub + corporate disclosures).
 Attach logistics paths (AIS / ports).
 Add impacts or metrics (CO₂, deforestation, labor risk).
