# Branch notes: implementing_debian_graphs (Oct 21–23, 2025)

This document records the work completed on branch `implementing_debian_graphs`, with
precise API signatures, UI behavior, and operational steps for Debian dataset imports
and server-driven pagination.

## What changed

- Pagination moved to the server with a dedicated publication and count methods.
- Home page shows only non-foldered items in its main list; folder contents are
  displayed and paginated within collapsible sections.
- The Debian ingestion script was rebuilt for reliability and ergonomics.

## Server API (new)

- Publication: `topograms.paginated(options)`
  - Options: `{ folder?: string, noFolder?: boolean, page?: number = 1, limit?: number = 200 }`
  - Behavior:
    - When `folder` is set, returns only topograms in that folder.
    - When `noFolder` is truthy, returns only topograms with no folder (missing, `null`, or "").
    - Results sorted by `{ createdAt: -1 }`, paginated via `limit` and `skip`.
- Method: `topograms.count({ folder?, noFolder? }) -> Number`
  - Returns a total matching the filter; implemented using `rawCollection().countDocuments` on
    Meteor 3 for correctness.
- Method: `topograms.folderCounts() -> Array<{ name: string, count: number }>`
  - Aggregates counts grouped by folder name (excluding null/missing).

Files:
- `imports/api/publications.js` — added `topograms.paginated` with `{ noFolder }` support.
- `imports/api/topogramsMethods.js` — added/updated `topograms.count` and `topograms.folderCounts`.
- `imports/startup/server/index.js` — imports the methods file so the client can call them.

## Client behavior (Home)

- Main list (non-foldered only): subscribes with `{ noFolder: true, page, limit: 200 }` and
  calls `topograms.count({ noFolder: true })` to compute the pager total.
- Folders: the sidebar fetches folder names and counts via `topograms.folderCounts()`.
  Expanding a folder mounts a `FolderSection` that subscribes with `{ folder, page, limit: 50 }`
  and displays its results. Each folder section has its own pager.
- Admin controls remain on both main list items and folder cards (Delete, Export).

Files:
- `imports/ui/pages/Home.jsx` — implements the subscriptions, method calls and pagination
  UIs (200/page for main, 50/page per folder).
- `imports/ui/styles/greenTheme.css` — small layout and pager style tweaks.

## Import pipeline (Debian)

Rebuilt `scripts/import_topograms_folder.py` to streamline bulk imports of `.topogram.csv`
files from a directory.

- Required flag:
  - `--dir <path>`: source directory containing `.topogram.csv` files.
- Optional flags:
  - `--folder <label>`: assign a folder label; defaults to the directory name.
  - `--clean-folder <label>`: delete all Topograms/Nodes/Edges for the folder before importing.
  - `--limit N`: import at most N files.
  - `--commit`: perform writes (omit to dry-run).
  - `--mongo-url <url>` or `--port <number>`: explicitly target a MongoDB; defaults to
    `mongodb://localhost:27017/meteor`.

Implementation notes:
- Fixed Python f-strings that embed JavaScript by escaping braces to avoid runtime syntax errors.
- Normalized edge direction fields; ensured `enlightement = 'arrow'` when required so arrows render correctly.

## Why this design

- Prior behavior limited the server publication to 200 items without proper paging; large
datasets (Debian: 827 maps) were only partially visible. Moving the cap to the server
with explicit paging makes the UI predictable and allows efficient queries.
- Non-foldered vs foldered split avoids double counting and aligns the Home UX with the
expectation that collapsed folders should not influence the main pager.

## How to verify

1. Restart Meteor to load new publications and methods (after pulling this branch).
2. On Home:
   - Confirm the main pager reflects only non-foldered items (e.g., Page 1/1 if none).
   - Expand a folder (e.g., Debian) and navigate pages within the folder (50/page).
3. Run the Debian import (optional) using the new script flags; confirm that `--clean-folder`
   removes old entries and that the resulting imports show arrows correctly in the UI.

## Cross-file doc updates

- `CHANGELOG.md` — added a section for this branch summarizing the changes.
- `docs/API.md` — documented the new publication, methods, and script flags with client examples.
- `docs/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` — added nodes for the paginated publication, count methods and
  the Home page wiring to them.

If you change the signatures or behavior of the publication/methods, please update this file
and the docs listed above.
