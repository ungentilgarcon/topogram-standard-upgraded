# Project documentation index

This folder contains the core documentation for the Topogram application (Meteor + React client). The files below explain the architecture, data model, dependency graph, run instructions and contribution guidelines.

Files:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level architecture and component responsibilities.
- `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` — mermaid-based dependency graph showing collections, server startup pieces and UI components.
- `DATASET.md` — collection schemas and field descriptions (Topograms, Nodes, Edges).
- `QUICKSTART.md` — how to run the app locally for development.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution workflow, PR rules, and a sample pre-push hook.
- `API.md` — where to find server endpoints, publications and methods.

Start with `QUICKSTART.md` to run the project, then read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DATASET.md` to understand the data model.
